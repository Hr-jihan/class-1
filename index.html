<h4>
    <p align="center">The past year was one that no small business could have <br> prepared for as the COVID-19 pandemic forced worldwide <br> stay-at-home orders and subsequent shutdowns. On top of <br> their usual expectations to adapt to changing customer <br> needs, many had to figure out how to digitally transform in <br> order to survive. Now, over one year into the pandemic, <br> many are still operating online or with limited in-person <br> capacity.</p>
    <p align="center">Despite this, we’ve also seen strength and resilience in small <br> businesses and entrepreneurs. Businesses are building back <br> and finding new ways to reach their customers, people are <br> still creating, and most importantly, recovery is in sight.</p>
    <p align="center" >Millions of small business owners from around the world <br> search every day for the things they need on Fiverr. The <br> services they are looking for and search terms they use <br> allow us to predict what’s important, what’s trending and <br> what’s next for small businesses. When looking at services <br> that have seen a significant increase in search over the past <br> six months, five major global themes emerged. It is evident<br>  that these are areas where small businesses and <br> entrepreneurs are focusing their efforts in order to to <br> rebuild, to pivot and for some, to even start fresh.</p>
